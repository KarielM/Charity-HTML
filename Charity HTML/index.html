            "The fur color of a cat plays a significant role in its fate"
            Statistically, black cats take longer to be adopted than cats of other colors,
            and they're more likely to be killed at shelters. "Black cat bias" also plays a factor
            as adopters may be seeking more photogenic cats, and black animals
            are thought to be more difficult to photograph. Black cats are also 
            considered bad luck in superstition because of negatived associations with
            witchcraft or evil. They can also be seen as less friendly and playful and more aggressive, potentially
            due to difficulties in reading their facial expressions.

           <h3 id = "eh">Our Actions!!!</h3>
           <p class = "mydiv">
            Here at <<idk>> we want to mitigate the negative assumptions surrounding black cats while
            providing shelter for any surrendered cats. We work in conjunction with communities to establish
            themed cafes to showcase our midnight fur-babies. Locals will have the option to interact with 
            any cats and see they're just as expressive and personable as cats of other colors. To prevent unnecessary
            euthanasia of fur-babies of any color, a portion of the proceeds will go to no kill shelters to provide
            funds necessary to care for a larger number of animals who would otherwise be put down due to
            capacity issues.
