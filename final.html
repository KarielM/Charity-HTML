                If you or someone you know is looking to open any kind of shelter or cafe, contact us
                and one of our staff will walk you through the requirements necessary to receive our 
                support. We highly encourage the focus to be on black cats, therefore locations
                with such focus will receive more resources form us, but we are always open to spmall 
                financial donations for the well-being of any animals that haven't been placed in their
                forever homes.

                        Black cats are also 
                        considered bad luck in superstition because of negatived associations with
                        witchcraft or evil. A black cat is also associated with bad luck, and sadly, death.
                        In 16th-century Italy, it was believed that death was imminent if a black cat would lay on someone's sickbed.
