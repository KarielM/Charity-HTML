                How It Started
            </h3>
                <p class = "bodytext">
                    We've been in operation since 2003 with small-scale salvations.
                    We started by adopting and facilitating fostering of black cats in 
                    local households. We've now branched out into providing start-up funding
                    for local business showcasing fur-babies of all colors but focusing on black 
                    cats.

                      "The fur color of a cat plays a significant role in its fate."
                      Statistically, black cats take longer to be adopted than cats of other colors,
                      and they're more likely to be killed at shelters. 
                      Despite studies showing that black cats are in fact friendlier and calmer than other cats,
                      they can still be seen as less friendly/playful and more aggressive.
