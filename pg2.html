                Here at Cats Against Humanity we want to mitigate the negative assumptions surrounding black cats while
                providing shelter for any surrendered cats. We work in conjunction with communities to establish
                local businesses and/or shelters to showcase our midnight fur-babies giving them a chance to disprove 
                the negative assumptions! Visitors will have the option to interact with 
                any cats and see they're just as expressive and personable as cats of other colors.
             </p>

                        "Black cat bias" also plays a factor
                        as adopters may be seeking more photogenic cats, and black animals
                        are thought to be more difficult to photograph. People report having trouble reading the facial expressions of black cats, 
                        resulting in people to feel more emotionally detached from the black cats.
